# API REST: Node.js Course Final Project 

The main objective of this project is to put into practice the concepts and skills acquired during UTN's Node.js course. 

I used Node JS + Express + Mongo DB to develop a RESTful API, which allows the following operations:

- Create: Allows to add a new product to the database by sending a POST request.
- Read: Products stored in the database can be retrieved through GET requests.
- Update: Allows to modify existing products in the database using PUT requests.
- Delete: Its also possible to delete specific products using DELETE requests.
